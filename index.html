        <p>I focus specifically on short fiction published in the last ten years – including collections by Lucy
            Sweeney Byrne, Claire Keegan, Nicole Flattery, Danielle McLaughlin, Claire Louise Bennett, Cathy
            Sweeney, Mary Costello, Wendy Erskine, Lucy Caldwell and June Caldwell, among others.
        </p>
        <p>Broadly, my work examines the ways that literature charts changes and transitions in the ideological
            underpinnings of contemporary society; my thesis explores literary representations of Ireland’s changing
            hegemonies, from traditionalism to modernisation and neoliberal late capitalism. As a researcher, I am
            interested in what it means to ‘write Ireland’ in a context defined by globalisation, neoliberalism, and
            a post-history outlook.

        <p>I also hold a first-class honours degree in English Literature & History from Trinity College Dublin,
            where I was elected
